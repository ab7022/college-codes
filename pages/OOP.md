# Object-Oriented Programming using JAVA

## Table of Contents

## Part A

-   [Write a simple java application, to print the message, “Welcome to java"](/Semester%202/Object-Oriented%20Programming%20using%20JAVA/welcome.java)
-   [Write a program to display the month of a year. Months of the year should be held in an array.](/Semester%202/Object-Oriented%20Programming%20using%20JAVA/month_of_year.java)
-   [Write a program to demonstrate a division by zero exception](/Semester%202/Object-Oriented%20Programming%20using%20JAVA/divided_by_zero_exception.java)
-   [Write a program to create a user defined exception say Pay Out of Bounds.](/Semester%202/Object-Oriented%20Programming%20using%20JAVA/pay_out_of_bound.java)
-   [Write a java program to add two integers and two float numbers. When no arguments are supplied, give a default value to calculate the sum. Use function overloading.](/Semester%202/Object-Oriented%20Programming%20using%20JAVA/method_overload.java)
-   [Write a program to perform mathematical operations. Create a class called AddSub with methods to add and subtract. Create another class called MulDiv that extends from AddSub class to use the member data of the super class. MulDiv should have methods to multiply and divide A main function should access the methods and perform the mathematical operations.](/Semester%202/Object-Oriented%20Programming%20using%20JAVA/multi_math_opt.java)
-   [Write a program with class variable that is available for all instances of a class. Use static variable declaration. Observe the changes that occur in the object’s member variable values.](/Semester%202/Object-Oriented%20Programming%20using%20JAVA/static_variable_decl.java)
-   [Write a java program to create a student class with following attributes: Enrollment_id: Name, Mark of sub1, Mark of sub2, mark of sub3, Total Marks. Total of the three marks must be calculated only when the student passes in all three subjects. The pass mark for each subject is 50. If a candidate fails in any one of the subjects his total mark must be declared as zero. Using this condition write a constructor for this class. Write separate functions for accepting and displaying student details. In the main method create an array of three student objects and display the details.](/Semester%202/Object-Oriented%20Programming%20using%20JAVA/student_marks.java)
-   [In a college first year class are having the following attributes Name of the class (BCA, BCom, BSc), Name of the staff No of the students in the class, Array of students in the class.](/Semester%202/Object-Oriented%20Programming%20using%20JAVA/first_year_class.java)
-   [Define a class called first year with above attributes and define a suitable constructor. Also write a method called beststudent() which process a first-year object and return the student with the highest total mark. In the main method define a first-year object and find the best student of this class.](/Semester%202/Object-Oriented%20Programming%20using%20JAVA/best_student.java)

-   [Create a package ‘student.Fulltime.BCA‘ in your current working directory. (12th)](/Semester%202/Object-Oriented%20Programming%20using%20JAVA/student_info_package_prgm.java)
    -   [Create a default class student in the above package with the following attributes: Name, age, sex.](/Semester%202/Object-Oriented%20Programming%20using%20JAVA/student_info_package_prgm.java)
